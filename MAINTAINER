This file contains notes that may be useful for maintainers.

First, here is a list of assumptions, some of which may solve problems right off the bat:
- This has only been tested and developed on 32-bit systems (indicate otherwise if so)
- You should install Nose Version 1.3.1 or later (the current pip version)



Running Tests
=============

If you want to run a single test at the command line:

   nosetests --tests tests/test-to-python.py:test_to_py_False
